# Skin-Disease-Recognition-Project
Skin Disease Classification Model
This project is about using deep learning to classify skin lesions into multiple categories. By analyzing images, the model helps in dermatological research and can assist doctors in making quicker, more informed diagnoses. It’s a step toward improving skin disease detection with the power of AI.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that identifies and classifies skin diseases using images.
The model focuses on 19 different conditions, including Acne, Melanoma, Eczema, and Actinic Keratosis.

By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves impressive accuracy in identifying these conditions. This tool is designed to provide support to doctors and researchers, saving time and improving early diagnosis for patients.
