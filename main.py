    Welcome to the Skin Disease Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying skin diseases efficiently. Upload an image of your injured part, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's make "Healing Skin,Healing Lives".
    ### How It Works
    1. *Upload Image:* Go to the *Disease Recognition* page and upload an image of your injured part with suspected diseases.
    2. *Analysis:* Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. *Results:* View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - *Accuracy:* Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - *User-Friendly:* Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - *Fast and Efficient:* Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the *Disease Recognition* page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset consists of images representing 20 different skin diseases, sourced from Kaggle. Unlike the original dataset with predefined training, validation, and test sets, this dataset has been split into training and validation subsets directly from the available data. The split ensures an appropriate distribution of data for effective model training and evaluation. Data augmentation techniques were applied offline to increase the diversity of the training set, helping the model generalize better to unseen data.
